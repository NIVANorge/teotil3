# TEOTIL3

TEOTIL is a simple, export-coefficient-based model for estimating riverine fluxes. This repository contains a new version of the model, TEOTIL3, which updates and improves [TEOTIL2](https://nivanorge.github.io/teotil2/) following recommendations made in [NIVA Report 7726-2022](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2985726/7726-2022%2bhigh.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

## Tutorials
